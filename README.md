# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sam, and I'm looking for my first job as a **front-end developer**.

## About me

* Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript
* Communication, collaboration, empathy
* [MLH Top 50 Hacker](https://top.mlh.io/2023)
* GitHub Foundations Certification

## My work

* GitHub's [Green Software Directory](https://github.com/github/GreenSoftwareDirectory): I added alt text to images in the README, making the directory more accessible for folks who use screen readers.
